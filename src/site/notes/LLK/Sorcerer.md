Sorcerers are magic users who have been imbued with magic by some circumstance, either of birth or chance encounter. They can be powerful, but also unpredictable.

Unlike [[LLK/Wizard\|Wizard]], Sorcerers do not need formal training, instead feeling their way through their magic and, often, creating chaos along the way.

There is a perception among the general populace that sorcerers are mad, influenced by some dark energy, perhaps [[LLK/Maarna\|Maarna]] themselves. There have been incidents where a sorcerer has been unable to control their abilites and have caused mass destruction. For this reason, sorcerers are not respected in most places and are actively disliked, even hunted, in certain areas.

In reality, most sorcerers are not mad and learn to hide their powers or adapt them to blend in and not stand out. Some even apprentice to wizards, though this is risky as Wizards have a strong dislike for the ease with which sorcerers can handle high level magics without going through a long apprenticeship.
