[[LLK/Mar\|Mar]] left her father's home with her friend, [[Margo\|Margo]], telling him that she had something she needed to do. Her father said she would be disowned if she left. as if she hadn't heard that before. She arrived in [[Rovanna\|Rovanna]] and went to the temple of [[LLK/Tau\|Tau]].  After consulting with the high priestess, she was escorted to the Palace. Her mission can be best served by joining the sacrifices.

[[Fen\|Fen]] was found by [[LLK/Talagar\|Talagar]], who called in his life debt to King [[LLK/Urion\|Urion]]. Fen resisted, asking for 24 hours to sort his affairs. Talagar and Fen were adversrial, not helped by Talagar's swagger and superiority and Fen's quiet resistance.

[[LLK/Capella\|Capella]] was told by [[LLK/Nisus\|Nisus]] that he had, inadvertently, put her name in for a sacrifice, and, after much debate, it had been accepted. She was upset, blaming the messenger, and generally furious. In the end, she had no choice but to accept, though she was certainly upset about it.

[[LLK/Vilento\|Vilento]] told [[Sigrid\|Sigrid]] that she was to be sacrificed in his place. He needed to stay, to help safeguard the kingdom now that such danger was upon it As his best apprentice, she was his choice. She protested that she could not advise the king as Vilento could, but he said he would take care of her family. So, she yielded and set about learning what she could about the afterlife.

The four were brought together to meet, [[LLK/Thallen\|Thallen]] being too busy to join them. It was awkward.
Sigrid recognised Fen's name from the histories of the kingdom, and knows that he was once slain and saved by the king. 

Mar told them that she was from the 'circle part' of Rovanna and had some important reason for being chosen.

Capella wanted to pet that dog ([[Ard\|Ard]]), and Ard encouraged Fen to be nice to Capella. Fen would not est or drink any of the food provided.

Sigrid tried to make conversation and give everyone drink.

After the meeting, Mar followed Sigrid and revealed that she was actually from the far south. Sigrid felt that there was more to her than what she was saying, but showed Mar the books about the underworld anyway.

Capella followed Fen outside, to pet that dog.
