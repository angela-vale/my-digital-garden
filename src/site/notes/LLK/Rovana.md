The most prosperous kingdom of [[LLK/Rovana\|Rovana]] was ruled by [[LLK/Urion\|Urion]], a High Elf favored by the Sun and adored by his people. After a long reign filled with victories against demons, necromancers and other villains, he willingly gave up his life to cast Resurrection for a fifth time. The Sun herself came to escort his soul to the underworld, and she has since remained in the divine realm, plunging the world into an unexpected darkness. A grand sacrifice of treasures and followers has been hastily organized so that the King will be comfortable in death, and the Sun may resume her usual visits to the mortal realm.
