**Biography**

My mother, Tu’raab Sage, was a world renowned Seer of immense talent and people traveled far and wide to seek her insight. She wasn’t some fortune teller quack and wouldn’t work on command, nor did she just provide insight to whomever came knocking. 

In my youth, King Urion travelled to our parts of the woods, far outside of his kingdom, to seek insight from my mother. During this time, I had befriended a fey, whom we later named Ard, and created a body out of moss, branches, animal bones, and antlers to provide them a corporal body to inhabit. After his audience with my mum, the King wanted to go hunting in the area. Unfortunately, he stumbled across Ard and I; mistaking them for a monster, the King tried to kill them with an arrow. Despite knowing that Fey are immortal, I moved on instinct and jumped in front of the arrow, and bled out. I died for the first time at the tender age of 28. The King felt immense guilt and shame for attempting to harm a Fey and for actually killing a young elf who had no allegiance to the king. King Urion felt it was the best course of action was to avoid angering the Fey for killing their friend and, as such, revived me. I now owed the King a life debt… 

Not long after this event, someone else came to seek audience with my mother. She turned him down given that she could tell they were there for nefarious reasons based on what she already “saw” prior to his arrival. In a rage, he killed my mum and fled the woods. Distraught and upset about how my clan responded to the murder of my mother, I left and established myself in the woods, shying away from regular folk.

I’m now 129 and live off the land in seclusion. As a talented tracker, my only interactions with people are as a bounty hunter who pay handsomely for my skills. If only I had these skills when my mother was killed… 

Once the King died after his final and failed resurrection attempt, his council members remembered the outsider that the King revived and called in on that life debt. They came knocking and gave me one day to prepare and settle my affairs before joining them. With no choice, I begrudgingly followed…
