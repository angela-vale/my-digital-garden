## One Unique Thing:

## Short Biography

To help my family, I pretended to be a [[LLK/Wizard\|Wizard]] from a young age so I could make a better life for them. Sorcerers don’t get any respect. People think we are all mad. Well, I’m not mad. Sometimes, I hear a voice. It's not very loud, and it doesn't tell me to do anything bad. I'm perfectly fine. And sane.

When I had the chance, I took the exams to become a royal apprentice. I passed and went to court at age 15. I worked quietly, in the background, until I caught the eye of [[LLK/Vilento\|Vilento]], the Court Wizard. He saw through my deception at once, but instead of throwing me out, he made me his assistant, maybe to keep an eye on me, maybe because he saw a use for me.

Before he dies, the King told Vilento he needed and advisor he could trust on the other side. However, when the King died and the sun went dark, Vilento saw an oppurtunity and nominated me as sacrifice in his stead. After all, the Kingdom needs a wise hand to guide the way. I hesitated, but then he said he would take care of my family. How could I say no?

## Extended Biography

Sigrid grew up among her mother’s people, the Hirthingi, a northern people who are known as raiders. Guthrun, her mother, was part of these raiding parties when she was young and that is how she met Sylris. The result of their fairly short affair was Sigrid. 

From a young age, it became clear that Sigrid had been born under the right conditions that gave her magic. It was also clear that it was wild and most likely sorcery. After an incident when she was 7 that resulted in a storehouse burning down, Sigrid and her family were encouraged to find a home elsewhere. 

They moved to a larger settlement, one where they could blend in and Sigrid's magic would draw fewer eyes. It was here where she first presenting herself as a wizard to ensure there would be no more issues.
