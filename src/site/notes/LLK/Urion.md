King of [[LLK/Rovana\|Rovana]] . A High Elf favored by the Sun and adored by his people. After a long reign filled with victories against demons, necromancers and other villains, he willingly gave up his life to cast Resurrection for a fifth time.

After 200 years of ruling, your king was satisfied with his life and ready to pass on the torch when his time naturally comes. BUT as it happens, his heir died before him. That's why he used the spell, to bring back his heir and secure his legacy.
