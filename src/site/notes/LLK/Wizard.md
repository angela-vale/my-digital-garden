Wizards are powerful beings who can control cosmic powers. They are also well versed in history, political science, economics, and accounting.

There are many schools of Wizardry in the land, each requiring applicants to complete tests that prove not only their magical ability, but their intelligence as well. Training starts young, often in the early to mid teens, and can be difficult. Many never make it through to becoming an apprentice.

As an apprentice, young Wizards are assigned a mentor who will assign them tasks and help them hone their skills. They are also responsible for filing, researching, and clerking for their mentor and, by extension, the mentor's master.

Most Wizards of any worth are employed by a lord, king, or other person in a position of wealth and power. They advise their employer on matters of magical nature, as well as more mundane matters. The most notable a wizard is, the more apprentices he may have at any given time.

Wizards who are not employed may work for any number of schools or may tinker on their own in towers or caves, discovering more mysteries of the arcane.
