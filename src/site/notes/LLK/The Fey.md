Weird, incorporeal beings who inhabit the mortal realm. Their pleasure seems to be in settling inside a physical thing, no matter what it is: a rock, a tree, a pond, an ant, a robin, a person? And slowly morph their host into a new fantastical shape. They say many of the strange creatures of the world are the result of fey shenanigans. Although they mostly stay in their own little land, there are always some roaming the mortal kingdoms.
