## Biography
Thallen is the Captain of the Royal Guard. They came to the court as a child and was taken under the wing of some of the older guards.

Like so many, Thallen idolized King Urion and chose to go into his service once he was of age, taking over the captaincy once the old Captain retired. They even saved the King from an assassin once, raising them even higher in the minds of those of us in the Court. They are something of a living hero themselves.

I know they have family that live in Rovana, merchants of some sort, and they visit Vilento every now and then. I'm not sure why they do so, for it hardly seems a social visit, but, as any apprentice must know, there are things the master will not share until his time is done.

Thallen chose to become a sacrifice, unsurprisingly. Everyone knows of their dedication to the King, and what better servant could the King ask for than his most trusted guard?
