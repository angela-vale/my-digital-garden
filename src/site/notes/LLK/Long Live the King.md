As the gods were creating the world together, a dispute emerged between the two most powerful of them, “[[LLK/PHOENIX\|PHOENIX]]” and “[[LLK/SUN\|SUN]]" But Sun rallied the others to his side and they imprisoned the troublesome Phoenix deep underground. The threat dealt with, they continued with their grand design, and soon after they gave life to the mortal races. After a while, the gods saw all was well, and they returned to their own realm, allowing the mortals to govern themselves.

 The most prosperous kingdom of (TBD ) was ruled by “[[LLK/the King\|the King]]”, a High Elf favored by the Sun and adored by his people. After a long reign filled with victories against demons, necromancers and other villains, he willingly gave up his life to cast Resurrection for a fifth time. The Sun herself came to escort his soul to the underworld, and she has since remained in the divine realm, plunging the world into an unexpected darkness. A grand sacrifice of treasures and followers has been hastily organized so that the King will be comfortable in death, and the Sun may resume her usual visits to the mortal realm.
