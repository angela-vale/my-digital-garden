We caught the mage, Anna, who said that [[LLK/Capella\|Capella]] was too impure to go to the Golden Vault. We turned her over to the new Captain of the guard, telling her that we suspected [[LLK/Lavinia\|Lavinia]] had something to do with it. The Captain said they would investigate.

To be safe, Capella stayed in [[Sigrid\|Sigrid]]'s room that last night. 

Before what would have been dawn, the party were escorted to a hill outside the city where rituals are commonly held. Most of the tribal emissaries are there, but not all. Many did not ant to stay after the death of [[LLK/Urion\|Urion]]. 

There, Vilento gave them each a small vial of poison and they drank.

The world around them seemed to dim, as if hidden by a thick black fog except where a lantern appeared, held by [[Lilal Rami\|Lilal Rami]], their guide to the after life. 

While at first, Lila Rami appeared as an elven woman, upon seeing [[LLK/Fenxalim Willowsage\|Fen]], she changed into the form of a young man, a man who could have been Fen's brother.

They greeted each of us in turn as the world faded, the lantern the only light. While they felt no movement, they were travelling towards the Golden Vault.

Suddenly, Lila Rami stood. they had a quick errand and would be back soon. Stay in the light.

The party was a lone for a short while before a demon appeared, his aura heavy and oppressing, his sin raw and burnt, still smoldering. [[Dimmu Azag\|Dimmu Azag]]. 

He tried to get them to sell their souls, tried to get them to agree to go with him. They began to suspect that Lila Rami had betrayed them.  When they refused to join him, he attacked.
