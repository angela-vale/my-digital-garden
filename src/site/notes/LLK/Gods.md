 Agender shapeshifters with the power of creation. Hundreds of them, though most are of minor importance to mortals. Each god has domains of interest, and although they rarely visit the mortal realm (with exceptions), they may hand out boons and powers if properly worshipped. Though they are fond of changing their appearance, the gods can be easily identified by their distinctive auras.*

  - “[[LLK/SUN\|SUN]]” 
  - “MOON” Though less powerful, they radiate a soft light of their own; they watch over the mortal for the second half of the day. Quiet & conscientious.
  - “HERALD” Sun’s right-hand, he rules in her place when she is touring the mortal realm and otherwise serves as her attendant and messenger. Very rarely leaves the divine realm himself. Carries the Sun’s sword of impossible feats.
   - “[[LLK/PHOENIX\|PHOENIX]]” 
   - “JUSTICE” The god of justice, wisdom and memory, one of the most celebrated by mortals.
   - (ETC… Feel free to make shit up.)

## In the underworld…
 
   - “OVERLORD” She has control over the entire underworld region of the divine realm, making sure everything is in order. Strict & fair.
   - “PSYCHOPOMP” Responsible for leading the souls of the newly deceased to the underworld, which is otherwise inaccessible to mortals. Affable & gracious.
   - “GATE KEEPER” Guards the entryway to the underworld, so no one can sneak in or out.
   - “JUDGE” Evaluates the souls of the dead to assign them their proper place in the underworld, each under the purview of its own deity:
   - “LORD OF GOOD ENDINGS” Their region of the underworld is reserved for the best of the best; a reward for mortals who distinguished themselves
   - “LORD OF NORMIES” Where most mortal souls end up, a calm place to rest until they are needed once more by the gods; meditative and melancholic.
   - “LORD OF BAD ENDINGS” For the really shitty people who need punishment, a place of endless torment
   
 The major gods are assisted in their duties by attending minor gods.
