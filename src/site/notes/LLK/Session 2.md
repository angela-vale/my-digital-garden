[[LLK/Lavinia\|Lavinia]] asked that [[LLK/Capella\|Capella]] make up with [[LLK/Nisus\|Nisus]]. It is an honour to go to the Golden Vault. 

Capella grudgingly went to Nisus and apologised. Happy to have an apology, Nisus invited her and the rest of the Sacrifices to a dinner party (Except [[Mar\|Mar]], who is off visiting [[Margo\|Margo]] in the city).

Dinner conversation was a bit awkward as the party continued to adjust to their new reality. They shared some of their motivations, talked of what might lay in the Golden Vault.

As dinner was finishing, 4 guards and a wizard apprentice charged in. They said there was an attack, and Capella must follow them to safety. When [[Thalen\|Thalen]] and the rest tried to determine the nature of this threat, the guards attempted to kill Capella. 

The party rose up, defending their princess. Even nisus took up a sword to defend his princess. Three of the guards were slain, the fourth knocked unconscious to get information later. As they fought, the wizard fled down the hall, revealing slain guards outside.

The party stands, shocked at the sudden violence, confused on why someone would try to kill the Princess when she was set to die the next morning.
