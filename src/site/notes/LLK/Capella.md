**One Unique Thing:** 

A god answers my songs. 

Most gods have retreated from the world. [[Enaludal\|Enaludal]] didn’t. At least, not from me. I don’t get visions or prophecies; I get guidance: a breath that corrects itself, a note I shouldn’t be able to hit, a melody that arrives whole and carries me through. It’s felt like a steady hand on my shoulder since I was a child. And I’ve always had the sense it wasn’t just kindness. It was interference. Like Enaludal planted himself in my life early on, filled my hands and my head with song, and kept me facing the light on purpose, because if Maarna ever looked my way again, I might have been easy to claim.

**Biography**

I grew up in a castle, but it was not my first home. 

I’m adopted. The version I’ve been told is this: King Urion himself led the assault on a cult that worshipped Maarna, and when the cultists were killed and the dust settled, he found me as a baby in the aftermath. Publicly, he took me home and took me in, made the adoption official, and the kingdom saw it as a great example of mercy and kindness. I do not remember my birth parents, but Urion tells me that they were elves. 

Urion was my father in every way that mattered, loving and often absent. He was hands-on as a ruler, always focused on his duty, always needed somewhere else. When he was there, he tried to give me a good life. Music tutors, all the best nannies and caretakers money could buy, extravagant gifts that would stay after he had to leave, again and again. He encouraged me to be the kind of person the court would find easy to keep around: pleasant, charming, unthreatening, because he knew he couldn’t always be there to protect me. 

I was never raised with expectations of power. The heir was already chosen long before I was old enough to understand what “succession” even was. My place was always meant to be softer: a pleasant conversation, a pretty distraction, proof that everything was fine. I would still inherit what any official child would, enough to keep my life comfortable and familiar. That was the promise. 

People have never fully agreed on what I am. Some treat me like a success story. Others look at my horns like they’re waiting for a dark prophecy to come true, waiting for me to prove I’m a demon. I learned quickly how to be easy to accept: charming, bright, agreeable. Not the kind of person anyone expects to be important in any way that truly matters. 

So I became exactly what I was raised to be. I sing. I make rooms warm up when they’d rather go cold. I’m not a strategist, just a pleasant distraction from politics that are too difficult. 

When King Urion died, I didn’t just feel grief, I felt terror. I couldn’t bear the thought of being left alone after everything, after being the child he chose. Everyone else heard about his death and started weighing it like a political problem; all I heard was he’s gone. So when it became clear I was expected to go, I didn’t fight the way I should have. Not out of bravery. Out of love, and debt, and fear.
