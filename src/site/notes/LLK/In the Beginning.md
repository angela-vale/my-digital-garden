As the gods were creating the world together, a dispute emerged between the two most powerful of them, [[LLK/Maarna\|Maarna]] and [[LLK/Tau\|Tau]], the Sun. But Tau rallied the others to his side and they imprisoned the troublesome Maarna deep underground. The threat dealt with, they continued with their grand design, and soon after they gave life to the mortal races. After a while, the gods saw all was well, and they returned to their own realm, allowing the mortals to govern themselves.
