As the gods were creating the world together, a dispute emerged between the two most powerful of them, [[LLK/Maarna\|Maarna]] and [[LLK/Tau\|Tau]], the Sun. But Tau rallied the others to his side and they imprisoned the troublesome Maarna deep underground. The threat dealt with, they continued with their grand design, and soon after they gave life to the mortal races. After a while, the gods saw all was well, and they returned to their own realm, allowing the mortals to govern themselves.

## More than a thousand years ago… 
As the gods were creating the world, a dispute emerged between the two most powerful of them: Tau and Maarna. But Tau rallied the others to her side and they imprisoned the troublesome Maarna deep under the mountain Cheltrem. The threat dealt with, they continued with their grand design, and soon after they gave life to the mortal races. They taught them to walk, to speak, to hunt, to build, to govern. Most people have kept a nomadic lifestyle, in bands ranging from a dozen to a few hundred people. A handful of city-states were established under divine patronage. However, as centuries passed, one by one the godsreturned to their own realm, leaving mortals to manage themselves. Only Tau and Ibbal continue to visit regularly and provide their light. 

## 140 years ago… 

Two nomadic groups, the band of the White Fox and the band of the Stars Eternal, were at war. The Stars Eternal came out victorious, and executed the enemy leader, Mede. Then Urion, her close friend, intervened to avenge her. He raised his own army, crushed the Stars Eternal and resurrected Mede. Grateful, she became his first vassal. But the Stars Eternal hold a grudge to this day, and bitter conflict between them and the kingdom arise from time to time. 

## The tale of Urion & Vanna 

Rovana remains the only kingdom, and it has continued to grow since the day Mede bent the knee, as other nomad clans and cities have joined willingly. King [[LLK/Urion\|Urion]] is renowned as a wise, valiant and merciful ruler, who possesses the love of the greatest god. He has defeated countless foes, most notably the vile necromancer remembered only as the [[Demon Heart\|Demon Heart]]. 

Seeing the end of his life slowly approach and wanting to insure the kingdom’s stability afterwards, Urion has been grooming his chosen heir for the last decades: [[Vanna\|Vanna]], an elf born in his court to the emissary of the [[White Fox\|White Fox]]. Barely over 50 years old, Vanna was popular within the court and had already proven her valor by seconding Urion in his offensives against the demonic forces on [[Cheltrem\|Cheltrem]]. 

When Vanna lost her life in a cruel accident, many where those who offered to cast the spell to bring her back to life. But it was announced that Urion himself would do it, despite knowing it would mean his own death. He quickly arranged the upcoming transition and prepared his ritual. Tau herself descended from the sky to escort Urion’s soul to the divine realm, plunging the world into unexpected darkness. 

Then… Nothing. The spell failed. Vanna remained dead, and the sky remained dark. A grand sacrifice of servants and treasures was hastily organized; perhaps Tau would return once her beloved Urion was given his due comforts in the golden vault. The question of who would take his place as ruler of Rovana would have to wait a little longer.
